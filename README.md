### Negative Indexing
People like to work with sequences because we know the order of the elements, and we can operate these elements order-wise. In Python, strings, tuples, and lists are the most common sequence data types. We can access individual items using indexing. Like other mainstream programming languages, Python supports 0-based indexing, where we access the first element using zero within a pair of square brackets. Besides, we can also use slice objects to retrieve particular elements of the sequence, as shown in the code examples below.

### Positive Indexing
However, Python takes a step further by supporting negative indexing. Specifically, we can use -1 to refer to the last element in the sequence and count the items backward. For example, the last but one element has an index of -2 and so on. Importantly, the negative indexing can also work with the positive index in the slice object.
